Branch folder contains 2 sub-folders: `app` and `storybook` for UI app and Storybook builds
accordingly.

App UI builds and Storybooks are hosted in GitHub Pages.

For access to the builds you can use these paths:

- **Storybook build** - `https://galacticcouncil.github.io/basilisk-ui/<folder_name>/<subfolder_name?>/storybook`
